  <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt><h3>What is a Yurt?</h3></dt>
    <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.<br>
      Each yurt is full enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a<br>
      roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
    <dt><h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3></dt>
      <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and<br>
      gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity<br>
      and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom<br>
      facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
    <dt><h3>What should I bring?</h3></dt>
      <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan top dress for<br>
      changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to<br>
      bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
